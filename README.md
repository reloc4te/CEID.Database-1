# CEID.Database-1

Here is a uni project in basic learning of SQL(Sql queries,procedures,triggers). 
I will upload the Schema of the database and the files that contain the code for each category.
Unfortunately the Schema is written in greeklish. 
This project was a team project, but done solo.


- ER diagramm and Schema Design
- SQL Create and Insert Statements
- SQL Procedure and Triggers
